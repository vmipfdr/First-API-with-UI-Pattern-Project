# UI Element Project

This project is going to challenge you to combine your programming skills in
JavaScript with your skills building out user interfaces with HTML and CSS.

## Prerequisites

- HTML and CSS
- CSS Layout
- Programming with JavaScript
- Working with the DOM

## UI Pattern

You will need to pick a UI pattern from the list below and an API. You'll then
build out the UI pattern you chose to work with the API you chose.

#### Slider

The user should see the content on the screen with 'Next' and 'Previous'
buttons. When they click on the 'Next' button, the slider should shift to show
the next item in the list. When the user clicks on the 'Previous' button, the
slider should shift to show the previous items in the list. If there is no next
or previous items, the slider could loop to the other end of the list or prevent
the user from clicking those buttons.

### List of APIs

This is a non-exhaustive list:

1. NASA: api.nasa.gov

There is also
[this collection of public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis).

## Requirements

Each student should pick one UI Pattern and one API and combine the two. The
data to populate the UI Pattern should come from the API. When the user loads
the page, they should see the data from the API load into the UI pattern on the
screen.

### Technical Requirements

Your project should meet the following requirements:

- Runs without errors
- Shows the UI pattern you selected populated with data from the API you
  selected
- Functions according to the descriptions above. The user should be able to
  interact with your UI.
- Includes a README written in well formatted Markdown (_hint: look up a README
  template_)
- Shows a good commit history with frequent commits. We're looking for lots of
  small commits.
